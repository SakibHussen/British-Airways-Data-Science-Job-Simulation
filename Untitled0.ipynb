Lounge access is determined by customer loyalty status and travel class, categorized into three tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) with varying access privileges. The goal is to create a reusable lookup table estimating the percentage of passengers eligible for each tier across different flight groupings, without requiring specific flight or aircraft details. This table will help BA anticipate lounge demand for future schedules, which may be unpredictable. Additionally, a justification must explain the grouping method, its rationale, assumptions, and scalability.\n","\n","## Approach\n","1. **Understand Eligibility**: Analyze historical flight data to estimate passenger distributions across lounge tiers.\n","2. **Group Flights**: Test groupings (e.g., Time of Day + Haul, Region + Haul, Aircraft + Time) to identify the most predictive and scalable method.\n","3. **Build Lookup Table**: Create a table with average tier percentages, passenger counts, and sample sizes for the chosen grouping.\n","4. **Validate Model**: Use a train-test split to assess prediction accuracy.\n","5. **Justify Approach**: Document why the chosen grouping works, assumptions made, and how it scales to future schedules.\n","6. **Output Results**: Save the lookup table and justification in CSV and Excel formats for operational use.\n","\n","## Assumptions\n","- Historical lounge usage patterns will persist in future schedules.\n","- Time of day and flight duration (haul) are primary drivers of lounge eligibility.\n","- Specific destinations or aircraft types are less critical than time and haul.\n","- Passenger behavior is consistent across similar flight types."],"metadata":{"id":"PEvwcNO4W_V_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as
